COVID-19 chatbot

The problem is to create a chatbot that can answer questions regarding COVID-19 accurately. To solve this problem firstly we prepared a dataset in terms of a JSON file which consists of all the FAQs regarding COVID-19. The data was collected from https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html#Basics . After collecting the data we used that data to train the model. The model was trained on keras library using Tensorflow. As the first step in model training all the sentences from the dataset were tokenized and stored in an array by which we received an array of all the keywords related to COVID-19. The model is trained using Neural Networks and the model used was Bag of words. By using a Bag of Words, we extract features from text used for modeling. In the architecture of the Neural Network, the first layer is a Dense Layer which consists of 128 neurons, ReLu( Rectified Linear unit) is used as the activation function. Second layer is a Dropout layer. Third layer is a Dense Layer consisting of 64 neurons with ReLu as the activation function followed by a Dropout Layer. To optimize the algorithm and find the best fit between predicted and actual outputs, Stochastic Gradient Descent. The model is trained on 200 epochs with a batch size of 5. And finally for running the chatbot relevant functions are written in chatbot.py
